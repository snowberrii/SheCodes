      <p class="introduction">
        Playing Mobile Legends is basically part of my daily survival at this
        point. The thrill of diving into chaotic team fights, pulling off
        last-second saves, or completely messing up (and blaming lag, of course)
        is just too fun. I love teaming up with friendsâ€”or randoms who may or
        may not throw the gameâ€”and figuring out how to win with whatever heroes
        weâ€™ve got. Every match feels like a new adventure, sometimes epic,
        sometimes a disaster, but always entertaining. And hey, climbing the
        ranks and flexing my skills? Just the cherry on top.

      <h3>So what is Mobile Legends?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</b> is a mobile multiplayer online battle
        arena game developed and published by Moonton, a subsidiary of
        ByteDance. Released in 2016, the game grew in popularity; most
        prominently in Southeast Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time
        with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-30 minutes match. Featuring
        traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes
        to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs,
        there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angleâ€”winners and
        losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.
